I'm Đỗ Kim Tuấn (you should call me Tuan), a Visiting Assistant Professor at UCSB. My mentor is <a href="https://web.math.ucsb.edu/~castella/"> Francesc Castella</a>. Previously, I was a postdoc at UCSB working with <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~sharifi/"> Romyar Sharifi</a> .

</p><p> I graduated from Princeton University in 2022 with a PhD where my adivsor is <a href="https://www.math.princeton.edu/people/christopher-skinner"> Christopher Skinner</a>. Before that I did Part III in Cambridge and undergrad at Imperial College London.

<p>
My interest is always Number Theory and Arithmetic Geometry. 
</p><p>
My (current self) interest lies in the p-adic world, in particular <a style="color:olive">Euler systems, Iwasawa theory, Galois representations, L−functions, their special values and p-adic interpolations</a>. My (younger self) interest is <a style="color:olive">gap between primes</a>. I also collaborate sometimes with my friend <a href="https://trungphan.squarespace.com/">Trung Phan</a>, leading to my (get away from math but still end up with math!) interest in some <a style="color:olive">Physics-Maths related questions</a>, for example <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.10.031017">this</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10867-021-09589-2">this</a>.

Here is my recent submitted work:
<a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~kdo/Biquadratic_ES.pdf">Anticyclotomic Euler system over biquadratic fields</a>
</p><p>
Here is my first submitted work, which is a joint work with Francesc Castella:
<a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~kdo/Diagonal_ES.pdf">Diagonal cycles and anticyclotomic Iwasawa theory of modular forms</a>
</p><p>
Here is my thesis: <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~kdo/Tuan_PhD_Thesis.pdf">Construction of an anticyclotomic
Euler system with applications</a>.

<p>
I used to be the organizer for the <a href="https://secure.math.ucla.edu/seminars/show_quarter.php?type=Number%20Theory">  UCLA Number Theory Seminar</a>, which happens (provisionally!) at 3pm Monday every week.

Bonus: Here is my wife Như 's brother, <a href="https://math.ucla.edu/~kdo/Bo.png">em Bò</a>, who used to attend lots of Zoom's Maths lectures/seminars.
